A tutorial series from [CODETutorial.io](http://codetutorial.io) .

The tutorial will explain how to create an hotel booking system from scratch using Laravel 5.1  and AngularJS. For this booking engine we will use AngularJS to create a single page application, the front end, where the final user can make reservations and the hotel owner can manage rooms, price and reservations. On the backend side we will use Laravel to create all the needed REST API to serve the application.
